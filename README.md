# Financial Loan Performance Analytics

## Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data, aiming to provide actionable insights into lending patterns, risk distribution, and overall portfolio health. By leveraging Power BI, we transform raw loan data into interactive dashboards that empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features

- **Risk Assessment:** detailed breakdown of 'Good' vs. 'Bad' loans, helping to identify potential default risks.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Insights into borrower profiles based on employment length, home ownership, and purpose of the loan.
- **Geographic Distribution:** Visual mapping of loan metrics across different states and regions.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL / Excel:** For initial data processing and cleaning.
- **DAX:** Used for calculating complex measures and key performance indicators (KPIs).
